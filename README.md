**Welcome to Marshmallow Toast Simulator!**


Your goal is to get your marshmallow to a scrumptious golden brown.  

Choose a duration of short, medium, or long to toast your marshmallow over the campfire.  

Based on this duration, you will toast your marshmallow and get it closer to Golden Brown!  

But be careful, too much toasting will burn your marshmallow.

Continue to toast golden brown marshmallows to increase your streak and go for a high score!
